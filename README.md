# Todo App
This is a simple todo app build with [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [redux](https://redux.js.org/).
It saves content in the local storage and supports history undo/redo via a reducer transformer.
Go [here](https://todo.haskai.de) to see it. An older version is also served on [github pages](https://hoff97.github.io/todo-pwa/).
